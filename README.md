# Machine Learning Portfolio
***
This repository is containing the portfolio project related to machine learning, specifically compiled with the purpose of displaying the builder skill and knowledge on the related subject matter. The portfolio is presented with IPython Notebook.

## Content
- __[Dark Social Classifier](https://github.com/walmondsh/Dark-Classifier/blob/master/Dark_Social_Classifier.ipynb)__ : A machine learning algorithm with the capability of clasifying "dark social" traffic away from the "direct traffic" categorization. Such result is completed through the process of "natural language processing" and "deep neural network".
- __Micro Project__ :
  - Sentiment Analyzer For Restaurant Review : A simple predicting model to determine whether a restaurant review is positive or negative.
  - Quiting Employee Predictor : A deep neural network capable of learning which employee is at risk of leaving the company.
  - Ads Effectivity Calculator : Machine learning model capable of calculating which ads in the most effective through reinforcement    learning
